{"name":"Velodrome","tagline":"onActivityResult handlers for Android","body":"One of the more painful pieces of the Android lifecycle occurs inside `onActivityResult`. The more `DialogFragment` and `startActivityForResult` calls you have, the more it inevitably descends into a mess of switch statements and spaghetti.\r\n\r\nA more reasonable approach is to encapsulate each piece of callback behavior into its own handler method. That is precisely what Velodrome does.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static final int REQUEST_DELETE = 0;\r\npublic static final int REQUEST_TEXT_ENTRY = 1;\r\n\r\n@OnActivityResult(REQUEST_DELETE)\r\npublic void onConfirmDelete() {\r\n\t// Burn the world.\r\n}\r\n\r\n@OnActivityResult(REQUEST_TEXT_ENTRY)\r\npublic void onTextResult(@Arg(\"text\") String text) {\r\n\t// 'text' is automatically extracted from the data Intent.\r\n}\r\n\r\n@OnActivityResult(value=REQUEST_TEXT_ENTRY, resultCode=Activity.RESULT_CANCELED)\r\npublic void onTextAborted(Intent data) {\r\n\t// Velodrome only fires on RESULT_OK by default. \r\n\t// You can override that behavior in the annotation args. \r\n\t// 'data' is the original data Intent passed to onActivityResult.\r\n}\r\n\r\n@OnActivityResult({100, 101})\r\npublic void onOther() {\r\n    // You can even declare a single handler for multiple request codes, if that's your thing.\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\r\n    Velodrome.OnActivityResult(this, requestCode, resultCode, data);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Performance\r\nVelodrome uses reflection to resolve handler methods. This means it isn't blazing fast.\r\nThat being said, we don't believe that the performance hit is substantial enough to warrant\r\nthe pain of dealing with annotation processing.\r\n\r\nHowever, we wouldn't be sad if some intrepid soul were to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Levelmoney/velodrome/pulls)!\r\n\r\n#Install\r\n```gradle\r\ndependencies {\r\n    compile 'com.levelmoney.velodrome:velodrome:0.9.1-SNAPSHOT@aar'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#License\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2015 Level Money, Inc.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
