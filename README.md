# Velodrome
An experimental Android library that attempts to simplify the onActivityResult flow.

# Install
We have started using [Jitpack](http://jitpack.io) for all of our open source libraries, so add the following to your app's build.gradle file:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.Levelmoney:Velodrome:0.6' // or whatever the latest version is.
}
```
